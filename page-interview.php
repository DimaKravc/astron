                            Capital Fund?</h3>
                        <p>
                            <small>Venture capital funds are investment funds that manage the money of investors who
                                seek
                                private equity stakes in startup and small- to medium-sized enterprises with strong
                                growth
                                potential. These investments are generally characterized as high-risk/high-return
                                opportunities.

                        <h3>What makes<br>
                            a startup competitive?</h3>
                        <p>
                            <small>
                                Statistics show that on average 8 out of 10 startup companies are bound to fail.
                                Meaning that only a few individuals are doing the right things, and most will tend to
                                mess up at one point in their journey which will send the entire house of cards tumbling
                                down.
                            </small>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <small>
                                It is quite understandable that most will fail, that’s because startups are literally a
                                journey into the unknown and entrepreneurs are constantly being tested in ways they have
                                never been tested before, experiencing and enduring multiple challenges that can even
                                breaking the best of us.
                                It is no wonder that many fail at it!
                            </small>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <small>
                                But this doesn’t have to be the case for us, by looking at the individuals who have
                                treaded this path before us and have succeeded, may help us identify the things make a
                                successful entrepreneur.

                        <p>
                            <small>
                                Therefore, having said that, I do believe the followings can help in determining whether
                                a startup will be successful or not.

                        <h3>How to maintain<br>
                            passion and motivation?</h3>
                        <p>
                            <small>
                                You have probably heard this point so many times that it has begun to seem so cliché.
                                Almost everyone who is successful at anything will credit passion and motivation at one
                                point in their story. Overused as it may be, it does contribute greatly to the success
                                of a startup.
                            </small>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <small>
                                People that are successful believe in what they are doing. And the more passionate they
                                are about it, the easier it becomes for them sell their idea to others. The successful
                                entrepreneur feels that they can make an impact and a difference in the world and are
                                constantly motivated by this. Successful entrepreneurs are competitive. They play to
                                win, and they hate to lose.
                            </small>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <small>
                                There is so much inertia and negativity around getting a startup off the ground, that if
                                you don’t have this deep-seated passion and motivation, you will surely give up.
